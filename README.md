Just a random compilation of some VHDL code i wrote while learning this language. 

## Double Dabble

## Moving Average Filter
This folder includes several implementation forms of a moving average filter.

## FIR Filter
This folder includes a implementation of a FIR filter. The filter has a signed 12 bit in and output and works on 24 bit internally. The test bench for the filter uses a .csv file as input with test vectors generated by Simulink.
